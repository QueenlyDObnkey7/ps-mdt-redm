# PS-MDT Converted to RSG Framework for RedM
This project is a direct conversion of PS-MDT to make it compatible with the RSG Framework and usable within the RedM environment. The functionality and features of PS-MDT remain unchanged, but the framework has been adapted to fit within the RSG structure.

# Overview
The original PS-MDT script has been migrated to the RSG Framework, ensuring seamless compatibility with RedM servers. This conversion provides server owners utilizing the RSG Framework the ability to integrate PS-MDT without modifications to its core functionality.

# Features
Direct Conversion: The script has been ported to the RSG Framework without altering or enhancing its original features.
RedM Compatibility: Fully adapted to work in RedM environments.

# Installation
Clone this repository into your RedM server's resources folder:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ps-mdt-rsg-framework.git
Add the resource to your server.cfg file:
ensure ps-mdt

# Configuration
Since this is a direct conversion, the configuration files remain the same as the original PS-MDT. Follow the existing configuration guidelines to set up the script to meet your server's needs.
